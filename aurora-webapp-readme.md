# Connecting a Web Application to Amazon Aurora
> A guide to setting up and connecting an EC2-hosted web application with Amazon Aurora database

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to connect a web application hosted on Amazon EC2 to an Amazon Aurora database. The implementation showcases Aurora's high availability features through its cluster architecture.

## Time Investment
- Total project completion time: 1 hour and 38 minutes
- Setup includes both Aurora cluster and EC2 instance configuration

## Key Components

### Amazon Aurora
- Relational database service designed for large-scale applications
- Uses cluster architecture for high availability
- Features two distinct endpoints:
  - Write endpoints: Handle update, edit, and delete operations
  - Read endpoints: Manage read-only operations

### EC2 Instance (Web Server)
- Hosts the web application
- Requires specific security configurations:
  - SSH access enabled
  - HTTP access from internet enabled
- Protected by key pair authentication

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Aurora Cluster Setup
- Created primary relational database cluster
- Configured database tables and relationships
- Structured for high performance and uptime
- Implemented SQL query capability

### 2. EC2 Instance Configuration
Key setup elements:
- Generated new key pair for secure access
- Configured security groups to allow:
  - SSH access
  - HTTP access from internet
- Set up web server environment

### 3. Cluster Architecture
Database cluster features:
- Primary instance for write operations
- Read replicas for read operations
- Highly available environment
- Automatic replication of data

## Technical Architecture
The system consists of:
1. Web application hosted on EC2
2. Aurora database cluster
3. Multiple endpoints for read/write operations
4. Secure connection between components

## Key Features
- High availability through cluster architecture
- Separated read and write endpoints
- Secure access through key pair authentication
- Scalable web server configuration

## Security Considerations
- Key pair authentication required for EC2 access
- Configured security groups
- Controlled internet access
- Protected database endpoints

## Best Practices
- Separate read and write operations
- Implement proper security measures
- Use cluster architecture for high availability
- Regular backups and maintenance

## Lessons Learned
- Understanding of dual endpoint architecture
- Importance of proper security configuration
- Benefits of cluster-based database architecture
- EC2 and Aurora integration patterns
